INVESTMENT PROPOSAL
THE BARGAIN
A Faith-Based Feature Film


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Budget Required: ₦20,000,000
 Genre: Faith-Based Drama/Thriller
 Target Audience: Faith communities, families, cinema-goers seeking inspirational content
 Primary Distribution Model: Church-based theatrical screenings
 Estimated Production Timeline: 6-8 months (pre-production to post-production)
We are seeking investment partners to bring to life The Bargain, a compelling faith-based thriller that explores grief, doubt, redemption, and the transformative power of answered prayer. Unlike traditional film releases, we are pioneering a church-first distribution model that leverages Nigeria's extensive network of churches to create a grassroots movement, ensuring maximum reach to our core audience before expanding to international church markets and streaming platforms.


THE STORY
Logline: When a bitter widower's daughter is kidnapped, his desperate prayer leads him on an impossible rescue mission that will test everything he thought he knew about faith, fate, and the voice of God.
Synopsis: Chidi, a retired inter-state bus driver, loses his devout Christian wife to illness despite her unwavering faith. When the church refuses to bury her until he pays her outstanding dues, his grief turns to anger, and he turns his back on God.
Weeks later, his daughter Grace and her classmates are kidnapped on their way to boarding school. The ransom demand is astronomical—far beyond anything Chidi can raise. Rejected by family, friends, money lenders, and even the church that shamed him, he finds himself completely alone.
In desperation, he returns to the altar—not with faith, but with a bargain: "God, if you bring my daughter back, I will serve you."
That night, while replaying the ransom call, he hears something unusual in the background—a bird song he recognizes from his years driving through Nigeria's remote regions. It's a sound found only in one specific area, hundreds of kilometers away.
Armed with nothing but his knowledge of the roads, the terrain, and a father's desperation, Chidi embarks on a dangerous self-rescue mission. What he discovers is far worse than he imagined—a camp holding not just his daughter, but dozens of children taken over months.
Through cunning, courage, and what can only be described as divine guidance, Chidi orchestrates a daring escape. The film culminates in an emotionally charged rescue, a tearful reunion, and a transformed man returning to church—not from obligation, but from genuine gratitude.

CLOSING STATEMENT
The Bargain represents a rare convergence of compelling storytelling, innovative distribution, and exceptional financial opportunity. By pioneering the church-first model in Nigeria's faith film industry, we're not just making a movie—we're creating a movement that will transform how faith-based content reaches its audience.
Our conservative projections show that even with minimal church penetration, investors will see returns exceeding 8,900%. At realistic participation rates, this film could generate over ₦5 billion in revenue from an initial ₦20 million investment.
More importantly, this film will:
Bring hope to families affected by kidnapping
Strengthen faith communities across Nigeria and abroad
Demonstrate that Nigerian stories with Nigerian values can achieve massive commercial success
Establish a sustainable model for future faith-based productions
This is more than an investment—it's a partnership in storytelling that matters, distribution that works, and returns that exceed expectations.


"Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." – Proverbs 3:5-6
